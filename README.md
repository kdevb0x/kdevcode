#### My version of gocode. I got tired of gocode working perfectly fine for days and 
then breaking out of nowhere, spending hours debugging, swapping out diff versions 
from various sources, (mdempsky, nsf, stamberre, liteide's) until one of them works 
for a while only to break again! So, I'm taking a whack at creating something I can 
use that gives me the same functionality (go autocompletion w/ suggestions for 
neovim) as gocode.

##WARNING: 
*__This version is <strong>NOT</strong> meant to be a 1:1 clone, and its 
settings and API are entirely different.__*  

See wiki for more information.
